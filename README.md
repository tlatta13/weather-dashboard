# Weather Dashboard

## Objective
This project required us to create a weather dashboard that allows a user to input a city to view current and future weather reports. Once a city has been searched, the user is then displayed with the city's current weather and the forecast for the next 5 days. Each of the users searches is saved to a sidebar where then can simply click to re-search the city's weather. 

## Project Accomplishments
* Built a UI to display the weather dashboard using html, css and js
* Created a side bar where search history is dynamically added to the html. 
* Used the Open Weather Map API to pull the weather information into the dashboard using jquery and js. 
* Displayed a list of useful weather data for users to view
* Quiz moves from question to question after user answers
